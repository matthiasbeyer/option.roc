# An "Option" type for roc

This package implements a `Option` type for the
[roc programming language](https://roc-lang.org).

**Note that the language is not released yet, so there might be daemons.**

---

I implemented this while playing with roc and because it was missing in the
codebase as far as I can see.
This might be obsolete when you read it, you should go check.
